# Trying to understand branches and commits 

1. **BRANCHES**
- *branching* lets you have different versions of a repository at one time
- branches are for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from the `main` (production) branch - when a change is ready, you can merge your branch into `main`.

2. **COMMITS**
- saved changes are called commits 
- each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made
- commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why
- to commit changes click on the *green button* 'commit changes...'
